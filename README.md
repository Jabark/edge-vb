edge-vb
=======

This is a VB compiler for edge.js.

This is an attempt to clone the C# version and convert to VB. My current lack of understanding means this probably won't work currently.

See [edge.js overview](http://tjanczuk.github.com/edge) and [edge.js on GitHub](https://github.com/tjanczuk/egde) for more information.
