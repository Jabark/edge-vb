edge-vb
=======

This is a VB compiler for edge.js.

This is an attempt to clone the C# version and convert to VB. My current lack of understanding means this might not work as expected.

Please fork on GitHub if you think you can help improve this project.

See [edge.js overview](http://tjanczuk.github.com/edge) and [edge.js on GitHub](https://github.com/tjanczuk/egde) for more information.
